# Efficient Data-driven Joint level Calibration of Cable-driven Surgical Robots
This is an open-source repo for sharing all training and evaluation code of the Paper "Efficient Data-driven Joint-level Calibration of Cable-driven Surgical Robots" published at npj Robotics

Please contact Haonan Peng (penghaonan1993@gmail.com) for any questions

The 3 .ipynb file can be run on Google Colab and no GPU is needed for the small neural network model. You may need to change the file path to your settings.

Detailed instructions on using these codes will be available soon.

All data is open-sourced at: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.tqjq2bw84
